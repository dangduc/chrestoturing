* Calling functions on temporary buffers from filepath in elisp

Some elisp functions require the user to be active in some buffer. However, sometimes the user isn't open to buffer nor wants to open a buffer. Or maybe the user wants to execute a function to hundreds of buffers. The following is an approach to apply a function to a temporary buffer given a filepath.

filepath -> buffer-context functions.
